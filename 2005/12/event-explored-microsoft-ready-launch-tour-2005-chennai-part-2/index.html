  The LeRoyal gave little bit disappointment in lunch. After finishing our first round (hey! we had very small amount of rice in this round &#8211; one of our guy told that it was priyani &#8211; but we didn&#8217;t accept!), we went to take some rice. But it was&#8230;?! The serving style was also not okay.
</p></p>

<p>
  The afternoon session was started at 0230p. It was divided into two track. One was Development (its like rajinikanth movie) and another one was Database (its like kamal movie). One of our team guy went to attend database track.<br /> </span><br /> <span style="font-family:lucida grande;">The first session of development was &#8220;Exploring VSTS&#8221; by Asuthosh Diwari and Ramakant. Asuthosh&#8217;s speech was felt like a marketing guy&#8217;s speech. His first punch dialogue was: &#8220;VS 2005 is not for developer; Its for development&#8221;. Before explaining that he showed one stat: </span><br /> </span><span style="font-family:lucida grande;font-size:85%;">In 2000, 23% of projects were failed, 49% challenged and only 28% success.<br /> But in 2004, 15% &#8211; failed, 51% &#8211; challenged and 34% &#8211; success.<br /> (But my prediction about VS2005 in succeeding years will be almost 70% success, because of the power and features of VS2005. its really amazing)</p>


<p> <p></p>

<pre><code>His one more added was: The main reasons for above failures were lack of integrated tools, separation of business and technology, poor team communication, project tracking but not managing, inflexible or immature process. No balance between productivity and predictability.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>After a pleasent intro about Visual Studio 2005 Team system (It contains tools for project design [ie. Visio], development [ie C#, VB, Web, SQL, and everything] and testing tool for both developers and testers), they&amp;#8217;ve given a demo of how the Team Foundation Server (TFS) collaborate the various activities of a software development.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>But what really happened was Ramakant tried to connect TFS from Visual Studio, it gave error. Then Asuthosh managed himself by explained different features of TFS.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>The TFS + SQL Server 2005 + Visual Studio 2005 makes software development life cycle very easy. You cannot by-pass design/development/testing.Then ramakanth tried to give another demo. It was okay.&lt;br /&gt; In this demo, he showed the easiness of creating project environment setting. In this, he simply place one IIS control, Application control from software concept design toolbox. VS2005 automatically asked the configuration settings for IIS and Application. Finally, they tried to give another demo. It was failed. Alas! it was bad time for ramakant.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>The excerpt from Asuthosh &amp; Ramakanth&amp;#8217;s session: VS2005 save us from &amp;#8220;Document Hell&amp;#8221;. So, it is not necessary to write technical specification, requirement specification, design specification, etc&amp;#8230; on Word/Excel. The test case also.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>The next speech was &amp;#8220;Enchansing Developer Productivity with VS2005&amp;#8243; by MS Janakiram. Well done Janki, you are the super star of this event. He didn&amp;#8217;t show any bulky slides (only 3 slides, 1. Welcome, 2. Session Content, 3. Thanks!). Purely demo! demo!! with sweet speech.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>His speech was very excellent and his demo was very practical. One interesting point he showed in VB2005 is:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;He wanted to find the mouse on current machine contains wheel or not. He typed MyComputer.Mouse.IsWheelExists in VB editor. Thats it!! it is exactly looks like a plain english sentence&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>Then he explained various features of Visual Studio 2005 such as refactoring, smart tag and so on very practically and neatly. Excellent Janaki!.
</code></pre>

<p>  </p></p>

<p>  <p></p>

<pre><code>&lt;strong&gt;Tail Piece: &lt;/strong&gt;What i thought about Visual Studio 2010 (hey not 2005!), there will be no need for designer/developer/tester. The client who wants a software can interact with VS2010 and it&amp;#8217;ll automatically create the software.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;
